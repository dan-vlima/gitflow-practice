This is a repository created with the aim to practice Git and GitFlow. 

Down below, the first commit of the project:

"Hello, world! I am the first commit."

And this is a change that, in the first moment, only exists in development branch.

Now let's imagine that this paragraph is a new feature from development branch. I'm going to pull request it within the release branch.
